# Holidaze Project Exam 2

## Project setup

To be able to run this properly you need a program that will allow you to host a local server. [I recommend XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

Install XAMPP and go to the installation location, open htdocs and clone or unpack this project.

For teachers: The server files are included in the src folder.

cd into the Holidaze project by terminal and enter:

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
To be able to see the project type: 
```
npm run serve
```
in your console. Open a browser and open `localhost:8080/` and voila.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
